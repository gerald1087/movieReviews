# Movie 1 Liner!


A full-stack web app developed using React, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, JavaScript, API and Axios.

This app was built to demonstrate our abilities with those languages/frameworks while delivering an app worthy of a small showcase.

Movie 1 Liner (name not final) lets users register and log in, create movie “review” pages that are then saved to our database and leave their best one-line review of the movie they chose, as well as movies chosen by others. 

The app pulls from the OMDb "open movie database" to source for the movie data and then using React State and props users are able to interact with the application.

There was a short deadline (impacted by covid-19 quarantines and isolations) to complete this project so some features needed to be cut for now, but this application as it stands works and fulfills the main objective set out when designing.
